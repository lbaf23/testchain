For example,\n    # consider the grid:\n    #\n    #     0 1 2 2\n    #     0 1 2 3\n    #     0 0 1 1\n    #\n    # Starting from the top-left cell, we can jump right to (0, 2), then to (0,\n    # 3) which is the next right-most cell. However, we can also jump down to\n    # (1, 0) and then jump right to (1, 2). In this case, we should also jump\n    # down to (2, 0) and then jump right to (2, 2). But this is not possible,\n    # because (2, 0) is not reachable from (0, 0).\n    #\n    # This problem is equivalent to finding the minimum length of a path from\n    # (0, 0) to (m - 1, n - 1) in a grid that is undirected and has cycles. If\n    # there is a cycle, Dijkstra's algorithm will fail to find the shortest path.\n    #\n    # Fortunately, Dijkstra's algorithm does not suffer from this problem. We\n    # can use it to find the shortest path from (0, 0) to (m - 1, n - 1) and\n    # return the number of cells visited in the shortest path. If the shortest\n    # path does not exist, return -1.\n    #\n    # We can use a priority queue to implement Dijkstra's algorithm. The\n    # priority queue will store the cells in the order of their distance from\n    # the start cell. The distance is the number of cells visited in the\n    # shortest path from the start cell to the current cell. The distance is\n    # initialized to 1 for the start cell and 0 for all other cells. The\n    # priority queue is sorted by the distance and the cells are popped in the\n    # order of their distance.\n    #\n    # The time complexity of this algorithm is O(m * n * log(m * n)) because we\n    # visit each cell at most twice (once when we add it to the priority queue\n    # and once when we pop it). The space complexity is O(m * n) because we\n    # store the distance of each cell in the priority queue.\n    #\n    # We can use a heap to implement the priority queue. The heap will store the\n    # cells in the order of their distance from the start cell. The distance is\n    # the number of cells visited in the shortest path from the start cell to the\n    # current cell.

They cross each other.\n    * If a robot passes by a factory that reached its limits, it crosses it as if it does not exist.\n    * If the robot moved from a position `x` to a position `y`, the distance it moved is `|y - x|`.\n    \n    Constraints:\n    \n    * `1 <= robot.length, factory.length <= 100`\n    * `factory[j].length == 2`\n    * `-109 <= robot[i], positionj <= 109`\n    * `0 <= limitj <= robot.length`\n    * The input will be generated such that it is always possible to repair every robot.\n    \"\"\"\n    robot.sort()\n    factory.sort()\n    dp = {}\n    n = len(robot)\n    m = len(factory)\n    def dfs(i, j):\n        if i == n: return 0\n        if j == m: return float(\"inf\")\n        if (i, j) in dp: return dp[(i, j)]\n        dp[(i, j)] = float(\"inf\")\n        k = 0\n        for x in range(factory[j][1]):\n            dp[(i, j)] = min(dp[(i, j)], x + abs(robot[i + x] - factory[j][0]) + dfs(i + x + 1, j + 1))\n        dp[(i, j)] = min(dp[(i, j)], dfs(i, j + 1))\n        return dp[(i, j)]\n    return dfs(0, 0)", "score": 0.0}]}
